Welcome to a showcase of some of my development work, listed below. You can also
find some of these projects as pinned repos at
[www.github.com/cjj1977](https://www.github.com/cjj1977).

## OpenAI GPTs

GPTs are specialized instances of ChatGPT, customized to complete tasks in a
specific manner, or to utilize bespoke information sources that may not have
been included in the OpenAI training data.

* [GPT development](./gpts.md)

## Python apps

While my more extensive Python projects are usually work-related (and cannot be
shared), I have a few smaller projects that I work on as spare time permits:

* [downthetube](./downthetube.md)
* [spelling_test](./spelling_test.md)

## PowerShell

Before getting more heavily involved in Python development I was more focussed
on PowerShell, as a tool for managing applications such as Microsoft Exchange
and for creating command-line wrappers (i.e. PowerShell modules) for APIs, etc.

## Open Source projects

I have made some contributions to Open Source project

### [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui is a browser-based front-end for Stability
Diffusion, a generative AI tool for creating images. I have contributed code and
ideas to the project, especially in the module that enables use of pre-defined
styles for images.

### [Siembol](https://siembol.io/)

I have worked on the Siembol project professionally, acting as a product owner
for the period that the project was active from (roughly) 2016-2020.
