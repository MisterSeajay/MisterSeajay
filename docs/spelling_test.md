## About

This app uses Google's text-to-speech API to generate audio clips of words and
asks the users to type those words in a prompt. The UI is simply a terminal
(shell) window.

## Purpose

This app is meant to be used to help children practice spelling words that they
may need to learn for school tests, etc.

## Use

The app is run directly on the command line--no frills!
