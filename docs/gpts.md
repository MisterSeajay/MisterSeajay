## About

GPTs are specialized instances of ChatGPT, customized to complete tasks in a
specific manner, or to utilize bespoke information sources that may not have
been included in the OpenAI training data.

## Motivation

Initially the purpose of creating these GPTs was simply to explore the new
feature(s) being released by OpenAI. Simple/trivial use-cases such as customised
DALL-E image generation seemed to be more fun. Over time these GPTs have been
extended slightly to explore how **GPT Actions** can interact with remote APIs
such as the **GitHub API** and **AWS Lambda functions**.

## Use

You can access the GPTs via the following links:

* **[The Arcane Paintbrush.](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3R9svhPj5-arcane-paintbrush)**
An illustrator for RPG characters, capable of using character data from the D&D
Beyond website.

* **[Vector Le Magnifique.](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-wagBADp7N-vector-le-magnifique)**
A creator of corporate illustrations, attempting to generate "flat" images
commonly used in PowerPoint, etc.
