# GitHub Pages

I'm starting to add GitHub pages to this "site", i.e. a personal page in GitHub.
This page is a short collection of notes about how I managed it, especially if
there were any gotchas even when following the official documentation.

## GitHub Pages Documentation

* [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
* [About GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)
* [Adding a theme using Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)

## Document structure

I have chosen to put my documents in the `/docs/` subfolder in my **main**
branch, rather than use a separate `gh-pages` branch, at least for now. It seems
a more intuitive to just use one branch from a personal GitHub Pages site.
