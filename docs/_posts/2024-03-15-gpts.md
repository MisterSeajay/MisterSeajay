I'm experimenting with GPT development for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).

GPTs are specialized instances of ChatGPT, customized to complete tasks in a
specific manner, or to utilize bespoke information sources that may not have
been included in the OpenAI training data.

Initially the purpose of creating these GPTs was simply to explore the new
feature(s) being released by OpenAI. Simple/trivial use-cases such as customised
DALL-E image generation seemed to be more fun. Over time these GPTs have been
extended slightly to explore how **GPT Actions** can interact with remote APIs
such as the **GitHub API** and **AWS Lambda functions**.

For more information on these, please visit my **[gpt.joynt.co.uk](https://gpt.joynt.co.uk)**
site, which will be more up-to-date than this post here!
