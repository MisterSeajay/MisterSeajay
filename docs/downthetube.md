## About

This app uses Python's FastAPI to serve a (very) simple web UI that allows the
user to submit a YouTube video URL so that the video can be downloaded by the
app and served as a stand-alone video.

## Purpose

The intention is to provide a means for family members to access YouTube videos
even when they are blocked from accessing _youtube.com_ links directly. This was
an important restriction during periods of home-schooling & Covid-19 lockdown,
when the distractions of watching YouTube were great but teachers needed to ask
students to watch specific videos.

## Use

This app works best when deployed on a server that has local storage into which
the downloads can be saved. By running this on a computer on a home network, you
could even share the downloads folder directly.
